 *  BAAudioContromWM8731 is a class for controlling a WM8731 Codec via I2C.
 *  @details The Codec power ups in a silent state, with non-optimal
 *  configuration. This class will enable codec and set some initial gain levels.
 *  The user can than use the API to changing settings for their specific needs.
