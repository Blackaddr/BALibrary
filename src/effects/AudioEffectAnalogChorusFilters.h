// Matlab/Octave can be helpful to design a filter. Once you have the IIR filter (bz,az) coefficients
// in the z-domain, they can be converted to second-order-sections. AudioEffectAnalogChorus is designed
// to accept up to a maximum of an 8th order filter, broken into four, 2nd order stages.
//
// Second order sections can be created with:
// [sos] = tf2sos(bz,az);
// The results coefficents must be converted the Q31 format required by the ARM CMSIS-DSP library. This means
// all coefficients must lie between -1.0 and +0.9999. If your (bz,az) coefficients exceed this, you must divide
// them down by a power of 2. For example, if your largest magnitude coefficient is -3.5, you must divide by
// 2^shift where 4=2^2 and thus shift = 2. You must then mutliply by 2^31 to get a 32-bit signed integer value
// that represents the required Q31 coefficient.
